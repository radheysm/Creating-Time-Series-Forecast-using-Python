1) Hypothesis Generation
Hypothesis generation helps us to point out the factors which might affect our dependent variable. Below are some of the hypotheses which I think can affect the passenger count(dependent variable for this time series problem) on the JetRail:

There will be an increase in the traffic as the years pass by.
Explanation - Population has a general upward trend with time, so I can expect more people to travel by JetRail. Also, generally companies expand their businesses over time leading to more customers travelling through JetRail.
The traffic will be high from May to October.
Explanation - Tourist visits generally increases during this time perion.
Traffic on weekdays will be more as compared to weekends/holidays.
Explanation - People will go to office on weekdays and hence the traffic will be more
Traffic during the peak hours will be high.
Explanation - People will travel to work, college.
We will try to validate each of these hypothesis based on the dataset. Now let’s have a look at the dataset.

After making our hypothesis, we will try to validate them. Before that we will import all the necessary packages.
